Based on the requirements and assumptions, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. A `Calculator` class that will perform the basic arithmetic operations. This class will have the following methods:
   - `add`: to perform addition
   - `subtract`: to perform subtraction
   - `multiply`: to perform multiplication
   - `divide`: to perform division

2. A `main` function that will serve as the entry point of the program. This function will create an instance of the `Calculator` class and interact with the user to perform calculations.

3. A `test_calculator` function in a separate test file that will perform unit tests on the `Calculator` class.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
